# NextSim 4 Kiwi 

## Notes

we want to emphasise the three judging criteria

1. Software Engineering
1. Impact
1. Quality

### Software Engineering

We:
- used GitHub
- set up an organisation
- had separate repositories for different compontnts of the project
- used the Boards to track TODO and work in progress

### Impact

Before today only Rafa had run NextSim on a docker container. 

Now we have converted the instructions from an email to a markdown format README that mutiple people can access

### Quality

We:
- had pull requests and these were reviewed
- did paring sessions
